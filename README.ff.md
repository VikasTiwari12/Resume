There are various types of obstacles and user has to dodge by moving left, right or jumping and if the obstacle touches the player then the game is over. PC controls are [Up Arrow Key to Jump and Left,Right Key for Movement]. This project is easy to operate and understood by the users.

An Infinite Runner is characterized as an action game, linear in design with no end, without pauses or breaks for rest and no stages or changing levels. It has one continuous level. The game difficulty starts slow and easy.
Venues include paths, streets/roads and railroad tracks. As the game speeds up, the players character appears to run faster and faster as if on a giant treadmill. Obstacles approach faster and faster, requiring ever faster reactions. The game eventually becomes so fast that even cat-like reflexes and laser-like focus isn’t enough. The player succumbs to the intensity and its game over. Ironically, they’re called “Infinite”, because for players they’re anything but that. For most the end comes far too soon</p>
